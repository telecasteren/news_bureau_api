### Motivation letter

Tough call. I decided to build the REST API with Express.js, because I want to become a fullstack developer. It's important to understand whats going on under the hood, and to know how everything is wired together, is in my opinion the key to create great software. And also, I've fallen in love with programming. :)

### Technologies

- Express.js
- TypeScript
- SQL

### Project structure

```bash

```

### Get started

#### Start the project

Clone the repository and open it in your IDE

```bash
git clone https://github.com/telecasteren/development-platforms-ca.git
cd development-platforms-ca
code . // or open with other IDE
```

#### Start the server

_Prerequisites:_

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Create a new database (news_bureau) with the provided .sql database export (MySQL Workbench/ other)
  - Database file: [Dumpxxx.sql](src/config/data/Dump20260412.sql)
  - Follow .env.example for DB credentials needed in .env
  - [import issues?](#database-issues)
- Configure your .env file (follow .env.example)
  - Generate a random JWT_SECRET:<br/>
    <b style="color: green">online:</b><br/>
    [generate-random](https://generate-random.org/base64-string)<br/>
    <b style="color: green">with node:</b><br/>
    ```bash
    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
    ```
  - (optional) Add custom PORT

**Then start the server by running:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Base URL:** http://localhost:3000/ <br/>
_or custom PORT if set_

**Swagger docs:** http://localhost:3000/api-docs/<br/>
_Can be opened in your browser._

Now you can use the API with Postman or any other application by following the API documentation.

💡 **Recommended testing route:**

<div style="padding: 10px; background-color: gray; color: black; border-radius: 4px;">
<ul>
<li>Start by testing all endpoints with empty headers and body</li>
<li>Then register a new user (try first with invalid body and then a valid body)</li>
<li>Login as the new user (try first with invalid body and then a valid body)</li>
<li>Create an article (try first with invalid body and then a valid body)</li>
<li>Fetch the article by its id</li>
<li>Try to update someone elses article (see database export for article ids)</li>
<li>Update the article (try first with empty or invalid body, then with one or more fields)</li>
<li>Search for the article by querying title, body or category</li>
<li>Delete the article</li>
<li>Fetch all articles</li>
</ul>
</div>

---

### OpenAPI Swagger

[swagger.ts](/config/documentation/swagger.ts) centralises all configuration of the Swagger documentation, including centralising repeated patterns used across routes.

When the server is running, go to **URL:** http://localhost:4000/api-docs/ , to see and test the API documentation. <span style="color: green">Adjust port to match where the server is running.</span>

**!Note!** The config allows a URL selection in the documentation, exposing all the URLs listed in the servers array in the swagger.ts configuration file. When used in production, these should be updated to the actual production and dev URLs. For now, I've listed 'localhost:4000' for prod and 'localhost:3000' for dev.

### Resources

- [Error handling with Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html)
- [zod validation](https://zod.dev/basics)
- [Swagger schema objects](https://swagger.io/specification/)

### AI Usage

During this project, AI tools such as Github CoPilot and Perplexity has been used to assist me in:

- Explaining concepts related to Express.js, zod and best practices
- Improving code documentation quality
- Providing commit message suggestions
- Debugging, ex: explaining or pointing to where 500 internal server errors

The file [swagger.ts](src/config/documentation/swagger.ts) is co-authored with CoPilot Codex.

**Important:** this projects architecture, implementation and code decisions are all performed by me.

### Database issues

Upon exporting from Workbench, the export finished with a warning:

```
Warning: A partial dump from a server that has GTIDs will by default include the GTIDs of all transactions, even those that changed suppressed parts of the database. If you don't want to restore GTIDs, pass --set-gtid-purged=OFF. To make a complete dump, pass --all-databases --triggers --routines --events.
```

I've looked into the warning, and tried to add settings `--set-gtid-purged=OFF` to make GTID not included, without luck. From what I could find, it seems the available working version of Workbench for MacOS ARM64, is not matching the optimal version of the app. Not sure its due to that, but it might very well be related.

Personally I don't use Workbench, I've kept to VS Code and DBeaver when working with raw SQL databases. So let me know if this is a known issue to you and you've got some tips on the matter.

**What I have done**<br/>
I've commented out the line inside the `.sql` dump that includes GTID, in order to make the import work.

<br/>

If you experience issues during import of the .sql dump file, please check:

1. If the import fails due to this error:

```
ERROR 3546 (HY000) at line 26: @@GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED cannot be changed: the added gtid set must not overlap with @@GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED
```

Open the DB .sql file in your editor, find and comment out or delete the line similar to the following:

```
SET @@GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED=/*!80000 '+'*/ '3d80be68-2792-11f1-83cf-43e6b8e8612c:1-108';
```

It's due to a default export setting `--set-gtid-purged=` in MySQL Workbench.

2. If the import fails due to any of these errors or similar wording:

```bash
ERROR 1840 (HY000): GTID_PURGED can only be set when GTID_EXECUTED is empty.

ERROR 1782 (HY000): Server is running with --enforce-gtid-consistency, but the statement is not safe in this mode.

ERROR 1236 (HY000): Could not find first log file name in binary log index file
```

<span style="color: red">**Please contact me asap**, and I will swiftly provide you with a fresh export file containing the needed GTID information.</span>
